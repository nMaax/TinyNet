# TinyNet

TinyNet is a straightforward implementation of a Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) built from scratch using Python and Numpy only. Inspired by [@karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy)'s [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd), this project aims to provide an educational resource for understanding the foundational components of neural networks without relying on ML-dedicated external libraries.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nMaax/TinyNet.git
cd TinyNet
```

## Usage

The primary code and examples are contained within the `main.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. To explore and run the code:

1. **Install Numpy and Jupyter Notebook**:

   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   pip install numpy
   ```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. **Open `main.ipynb`**: In the Jupyter interface, navigate to the `TinyNet` directory and open `main.ipynb`.

4. **Run the Notebook**: Execute the cells sequentially to build and train the neural network.

## Project Structure

- `NN/`: Contains the core neural network implementation.
- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the usage of the neural network.
- `LICENSE`: Project license information.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files to ignore in the repository.
